        for a play date. When it came time for a snack, her mom
        asked her to find out what everyone wanted. Rachel was happy
        to help because she loved playing hostess. However, when Rachel
        got back to her mom, she couldn\'t quite remember everything. Can you help her figure it out?</string>
